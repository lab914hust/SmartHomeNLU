# Building Vietnamese Conversational Smart Home Dataset and Natural Language Understanding Model
 
- We introduce a public intent detection and slot filling dataset for Vietnamese.
- The scenario we chose to build the dataset was conversations between a smart home system and its owner.
- The data were cleaned then processed to build set of user request templates as well as that of slot values. 
- Many data generating and sampling techniques were examined to choose the most suitable one to create actual utterances from these 2 sets.
